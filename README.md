# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This prework study guide has been created to show off some of the basic skills learnt over the period of the prework course. It includes tips on subjects such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I created this guide to help me over the next four months of the front end web development bootcamp. It will give me a place to keep adding notes to.

A console panel will open up and you will see a list of the four topics.
